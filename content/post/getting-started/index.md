## My Journey From Education to Business Analytics

My career journey has been one of evolution and discovery. With a Master's degree in Education from the University of Huddersfield, I initially dedicated myself to the educational field, working as an Educational Consultant at the University of Science and Technology of Hanoi. During this time, I developed a passion for problem-solving, data analysis, and identifying opportunities for improvement.

Working closely with financial aspects of educational programs, I discovered my aptitude for working with numbers and analyzing data. Implementing expense tracking systems, performing budget reconciliations, and conducting financial analyses that contributed to enrollment increases all confirmed my interest in the analytical side of organizations.

## Why Business Analytics?

My decision to pursue an MBA at Concordia University Texas represents a strategic step toward transitioning into business analytics and consulting. Through this program, I'm enhancing my analytical capabilities, particularly in tools like Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, and SQL, while gaining a comprehensive understanding of business operations and strategy.

I believe my educational background provides me with a unique perspective in approaching business challenges:

1. **Communication skills**: My experience in education has honed my ability to explain complex concepts clearly and effectively.

2. **Problem-solving approach**: Working in educational environments requires creative solutions to diverse challenges.

3. **Analytical mindset**: My previous roles involving budget management and financial analysis have prepared me for data-driven decision making.

## Looking Forward

As I continue my MBA journey, I'm eager to apply my expanding business acumen and analytical skills to solve complex organizational challenges. Business analysis sits at the intersection of my natural strengths and professional interestsâ€”combining my ability to understand stakeholder needs with my growing technical capabilities.

I look forward to leveraging my unique blend of educational expertise and business knowledge to deliver insightful analysis, strategic advice, and practical solutions that drive organizational success.

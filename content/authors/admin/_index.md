My name is Dat Nguyen and I am a data enthusiast.

I worked at Deloitte Advisory as a BI senior consultant/data analyst. I’ve spent the past 5 years working with data and performing strategic financial impact analyses to help clients in various industries improve their performances and drive revenues.

In the winter of 2021, I interned at NBCUniversal as a data scientist, working on a graph-based recommender system. I finished my second internship with NVIDIA for their Geforce NOW - cloud gaming team.

As much as I am into data manipulating, it is the analysis of the data and how to uncover the relationships between numbers, translate the digits and spreadsheets into meaningful stories are that drive me forward. I take pride in my abilities to make data accessible and assist executives to make informed decisions that improve efficiency, risk management, and profits.

I am an education professional transitioning into the business sector, currently seeking opportunities in consulting, audit, data analytics, and product management.

Holding a Master of Art degree in Education from the University of Huddersfield, I am currently broadening my expertise through an MBA at Concordia University Texas, set to complete in May 2025. This program is enhancing my analytical capabilities, particularly in Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, and SQL while deepening my understanding of business strategies and operations.

With an ambition to transition into consulting or analysis roles, I am keen to apply my evolving business acumen and robust educational background to solving complex challenges within educational institutions or business entities. My goal is to leverage my unique blend of skills to deliver insightful analysis, strategic advice, and practical solutions that drive organizational success and educational excellence. I am passionate about continuous learning, fostering teamwork, and making impactful contributions to my working environment.

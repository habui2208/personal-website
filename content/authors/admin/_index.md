My name is Dat Nguyen and I am currently a Master's student, studying Data Science at the University of Pennsylvania.

Prior to joinning Penn, I worked at Deloitte Advisory as a business analytics senior consultant. I've spent the past 5 years working with data and perform strategic financial impact analyses to help clients in various industries improve their performances and drive revenues.

As much as I am into data manipulating, it is the analysis of the data and how to uncover the relationships between numbers, translate the digits and spreadsheets into meaningful stories are what drive me forward. I take pride in my abilities to make data accessible and assist executives to make informed decisions that improve efficiency, risk management and profits.
